<h2>What does HOSA mean by "Competitions"?</h2>

<p class ="p1">HOSA is not just a gathering of students that enjoy talking about health care, it is an organization that also provides opportunities for members to preform competitively with other people interested in the same medical subject. Through North Gwinnett HOSA, we have had more than a hundred members participate in the SLC competitions- ranging from speeches about the future to reading a written essay about how Dr. James R. Doty persevered from his difficult childhood to become a world renown neurosurgeon. The events and conference sessions are so fascinating, and what is even more fun is when by the end of the competition our suitcases are a lot heavier than when we first arrive!<br>
<br>
    <b>Sounds Great! How Do I Get Involved?:</b><br>
    ​At the September informational meeting the HOSA executive board will be informing the members of the different types of events (competitions) available. We say "events" because that is what the competitions are officially called. <b>For the curious bunch, specific competition guidelines can be found <a href ="http://www.hosa.org/guidelines">here</a>. </b><br>
    ​<br>
                  <i class="i">a- *<b>Health Science Events</b>: Follows the traditional multiple choice format with a short response question at the end. We will provide you with specific test details after you have officially decided the type of knowledge test youwill be taking (we advise only taking one knowledge to avoid scheduling conflict on competition day).<br></i>
                  <i class="i">b- *<b>Health Professions Events</b>: Follows a two-test format. This means that the first test will be a multiple choice with a written response. The score on the first part will decide who gets to move to the second part. The next test will be a physical demonstration of a given scenario in front of judges. More information will be given to the specific members who choose these events. </i><br>
                  <i class="i">c- <b>Emergency Preparedness Events</b>: This follows the same format as Health Professions Events; however, the types of events in this category are more zoned to hands-on demonstrations of emergency medicine. (First aid, CPR, Life Support Skills, etc.)</i><br>
                    <i class="i">d- <b>Leadership Events</b>: This category is composed multiple competitions solely based on leadership skills. There could be multiple choice, an essay, a trifold presentation, or a one-on-one with a judge- it all depends on which event is chosen in this category. </i><br>
                      <i class="i">e- *<b>Teamwork Events</b>: These events are very fun! Teamwork events include many different events such as a group presentation, participating in a team debate, writing essays, preforming a medical skill (CPR etc.), and many more. </i><br>
                        <i class="i">f- <b>Recognition Events</b>: These events are based on the accomplishments of our HOSA chapter as a whole. More detail will be given out about these events during chapter meetings. </i><br>
<br>    
     <b>2</b>- By a date TBD (to be determined), we will be asking members who want to participate in the State Leadership Conference (SLC) to submit the top few competitions they are interested in. <br>
     <b>3</b>- By a TBD date, we will be handing out the official competition information (a packet containing all of the details about dress code, competition times, room numbers, and information that could be helpful when studying for the events) to the competitors. We will do our best to send out the information above whenever the Georgia HOSA committee releases it. <br>
     <b>4</b>- On January (unknown date), the regional testing (for the events that require it) will be held at one of the computer labs at NGHS- the room number will be shared as the date comes closer. Members who take the regional test and pass will qualify for SLC.  However, members who take the regional test & do not make it to the next round of testing, are highly encouraged to attend SLC for the many opportunities and workshops to learn and experience the vast field of healthcare. Note: Certain events do not require a regional test to make it to the state level (ex: speeches, presentations, building events, etc).<br>
    ​ <b>5</b>- On February 28th, members who made it to SLC will be traveling the Atlanta Marriott Marquis. The first and second days will be testing days- the second day has more sessions. Sessions are activities that participators of SLC can attend in order to learn more about a given field of study. The hot topic during 2018's SLC was the forensic pathologist and the cardiothoracic surgeon who displayed an open heart surgery. In 2022, there was CPR workshops, and in 2023, we attended a service dog workshop! The last day is the awards ceremony. It is also the day that everyone seems to leave with more friends. Wonder why?<br>
    <b>6</b>- Members that place in the competitions at SLC are automatically put into the international competition (ILC) which in 2023 will be held aim Dallas, Texas! We really hope members take up this opportunity to experience all that HOSA has to offer, it is crazy fun!!!

  <i class="i">-We will be informing the members more information once everyone has been signed up for SLC.</i><br>
