  Dr. Rhonda Hogan works as a pediatric dentist. She graduated from the University of Kentucky, and is now currently working at Suwanee Pediatric Dentistry. She comes from a rural background and originally wanted to go to medical school until she applied for dental school last second.
</p>

<p class="p2">
  Dr. Nora Hanna, a pediatric psychiatrist, has her own practice in Suwanee and also sees many students as her patients within North. Whenever she comes to visit our chapter, she always gives out great mental health care tips.  
</p>

<p class="p3">
  PCOM GA, located close to our school campus, was gracious enough to send their DO ambassadors for a guest speaker event. The medical students taught us what a DO degree was, osteopathic techniques, as well as offering us a student panel for a Q&A session. Thank you Courtney and Pooja! (And, thank you Melissa!)
</p>

<p class="p4">
  Linda Cosby teaches those with disabilities how to swim. She has been with the Swim AngelFish Georgia Agency for over 20 years and is the head! Linda taught us what it is like working with people of all abilities, how to get involved with AngelFish, and showed us adaptive water equipment. 
</p>

<p class="p5">
  Dr. Stephen Summerow is an optometrist who specializes in treating ocular diseases. We had the opportunity to learn about his pathway to optometry, his experience with lasek surgery, as well as his background as a black man in healthcare and politics!

<p class="p6">
  Heather Hall works with our Suwanee Town Center council and also works as a physician assistant in neurology.

<p class="p7">
  Dr. Larry Mellick is an emergency medicine physician who also is the vice chair/ professor of emergency medicine and division chief! Another fun fact is that he has a YouTube channel with over 500k subscribers! We had the privilege of having Dr Larry Mellick over zoom to teach us about emergency medicine and his journey.

  Dr. David Whiteman is a cosmetic, plastic, and reconstructive surgery specialist and is Northside Hospital’s Chief of Plastic Surgery and Surgical services. He taught our chapter about his path towards becoming a plastic surgeon and about creating his own practice.
